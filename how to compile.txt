===============
how to compile:
===============

install visual studio 2017 community edition
use c++ option/pack during install (desktop development with c++)
the required xinput library and h file from DXSDK_Jun10.exe is already present in lib folder of the project so you don't need to search for them
make sure to set the "platform" in visual studio to "x86" before you compile


======================================
In case you're recreating the project:
======================================

libraries are linked by placing something like this into the source:

#include <vjoyinterface.h>
#pragma comment(lib, "lib\\vJoyInterface.lib") 

#include <Xinput.h>
#pragma comment(lib, "lib\\XInput.lib")

also, the "inc" path should be added to "include directories", this is done like this:
click on project in solution explorer (the tree-like window on the left)
open project properties by pressing the wrench icon
then select the configuration you're using and add inc at the end of the entry here:
configuration properties - vc++ directories - Include directories
vjoy header files are in the inc directory


==========================================
other useful things in project properties:
==========================================

setting:
configuration properties - C/C++ - code generation - runtime library
to:
"/MT" means that a visual C/C++ runtime code will be added to the created executable - bigger exe file
"/MD" means that runtime code will not be added to the executable and that the Visual Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015 has to be installed on the system that runs this - smaller exe file

linking libraries to the project can also be achieved by adding them to this setting:
configuration properties - linker - input - additional dependencies

switching from console app to nonconsole app:
configuration properties - linker - system - subsystem
